This is my completed assignment for the Year 3 Mobile App Development. The content of this module is not really my cup of tea but I gave it my best shot! Thanks very much to Ash for all the support throught the unit and for keeping me interested.
I came into the project not liking javascript, and dont get me wrong I still hate it, but I like the functional features of the language and try to use them as much as possible over imperative style in this project.
This readme will disect the markscheem acossiated with this work to higlight what has been achived.

# Functionality
I will demonstarte where to find the evidence for each endpoint. All endpoints have been achived to my knowladge.

# Exteintion
I found this part rather cumbersome as my Chat file was already large before I started implementing the draft features. 

I would argue that both tasks have been completed to a professional standard, the quality of the code is fine and the user experiance is good. The efficiency of the drafts sending scheduling messages is not so good however, as I imagin there is a much more elegent solution that constantly looking to see if a scheduled draft needs to be sent.

# User Experiance
The style is very consistant throught the project even though there is no use of global styles. Each button has been made very large to acomidate for anyone, and there are only 3 main colours present throught the whole project, red, green and white (i know its a shade shut up). 
Acessability has been adressed in the form of catering to 3 langauges I18n.
Frameworks have been used for drafts, where a pre made calandar is used to select when a draft should be sent.

# Additional Skills
Throught this project I have used a linter. 
This repository is an example of the use of git.
My code is "chef kiss" very nice.


# Conclusion
Overall I woudl be happy with a 95. I think that is hwo I see the project in respect to the markscheem. Maybe im dlusional but you get what you get at the end of the day.
